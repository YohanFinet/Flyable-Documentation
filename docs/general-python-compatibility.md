## How does Flyable work with Python?

Flyable is compiling Python code into executable files or WebAssembly instructions. To do this, it uses a type discovery algorithm and then makes optimisations before generating the desired output.

## Does Flyable support all versions of Python?

Flyable currently supports a subset of Python 3. It supports most of Pythonâ€™s use cases, but currently has restrictions relative to data types. Learn more about these restrictions.

## Can Flyable make use of Python libraries?

Of course! We are working hard to enable you to use existing Python libraries with Flyable. Click here to see all the libraries that Flyable supports.
