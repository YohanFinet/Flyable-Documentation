## How does Flyable make Python faster and more lightweight?

The compiler applies strong type inference combined with type specialisation to allow strong optimization to your code before generating desktop executables or WebAssembly instructions.

## What are the current APIs and GUIs that come with Flyable?

Flyable comes with its own GUI library to enable you to build nice looking GUIs on desktop and on the web. APIs that will be included in the Beta version are: 

##How does the Flyable compiler work?

Flyable is compiling Python code into executable files or WebAssembly instructions. To do this, it uses a type discovery algorithm and then makes optimisations before generating the desired output.
