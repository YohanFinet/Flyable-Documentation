# Typing Style / Syntax

## Are there any differences with Python's syntax?

All the code that compiles with Flyable can be interpreted by the Python interpreter. The opposite is not always true for the moment, Flyable has some typing restrictions relative to CPython and is not supporting all Python libraries.

## Could I compile my pre-existing Python code?

Sure, as long as it stays in the bounds of the Python functionalities that Flyable supports right now.

## How does Flyable compare to JS or HTML/CSS?

Flyable enables Python to build website front-ends since it can generate WebAssembly instructions and comes with a GUI library. This means that you will now be able to use Python to build full websites. No more need to use JS, HTML or CSS!
